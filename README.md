Phase 3 of building a Compiler

1) A syntax checker is a program that checks syntax errors in a program code. The syntax checker reads a source code, checks if there is any syntax error, and outputs error messages describing any syntax errors found. 
2) A parse tree generator is a program that builds the parse tree from the source code.|
3) An indenter is a program that updates the indentation of a source code, which improves its readability. Building the parse tree of the source code can be performed while checking the syntax of the source, and updating the indentation of the source code can be performed from the parse tree.
